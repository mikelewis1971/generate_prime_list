Ever wondered if there's more to prime sieving than just eliminating composites? Check out the **Lewis Sieve** – it’s not only an extension of the classic Sieve of Eratosthenes, but it also *propagates* primes to record factorization by default!

Here's the scoop:  
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** Simply removes multiples of each prime, leaving a flat list of primes.  
- **Lewis Sieve:** Does that *and* organizes surviving primes into hierarchical “bins” that inherently show which primes eliminated a composite. In short, as you sieve, you’re automatically factoring numbers without brute force!

This built-in factorization offers deeper insight into number structure and could change the way we approach prime analysis. Curious to learn more?
